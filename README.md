# Gotep - a hub for LLM testing

I am currently in the beginning phases of testing how LLM's can
be applied to the Infrastructure as Code space. My general belief is 
that this could be a very good space for AI since AI does really well 
with boilerplate code. Infrastructure code in my opinion is critical but
definitely falls under the "boilerplate" category in my mind.

I think LLM's can help create more human friendly interfaces for interacting
with application dependent infrastructure.

## Running the Project
