### question
What files would I need to create and what hcl code would I need inside them to create a new VPC in AWS 
and creates a VM in that VPC? Output the VM's public IP address.

After you show me the code tell me step by step how I would go about creating each file 
and running terraform. Warn me if there are any gotchas.

Be as detailed as possible.
